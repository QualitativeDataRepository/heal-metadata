# heal-metadata
HEAL metadata for dataverse

This is a metadata block for dataverse that implements support for NIH HEAL metadata.

Most, but not all fields are included in the `heal_block.tsv` file. Redundant fields with the default dataverse citation block are listed in the `map_existing_fields.csv` file.
